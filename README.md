This repository contains the R scripts used to run simulations, summarize their results and produce figures associated with a manuscript entitled "Realistic scenarios of missing taxa in phylogenetic comparative methods and their effects on model selection and parameter estimation", submitted to PeerJ on June 2019.

If you need help understanding or re-using my scripts, please feel free to email me at raf.marcondes@gmail.com

If you adapt ot re-use any of my scripts, please consider citing this repository or the PeerJ manuscript in any resulting publications.

The results of the simulations used to write the manuscript are available in https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6c29pkzzwd1lqc/correlated_absent_random_MT.zip?dl=0 and https://www.dropbox.com/s/6aulp8m2orlfuje/clumped_MT.zip?dl=0
