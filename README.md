This repository contains the R scripts used to run simulations, summarize their results and produce figures associated with a manuscript entitled "Realistic scenarios of missing taxa in phylogenetic comparative methods and their effects on model selection and parameter estimation", submitted to PeerJ on June 2019.

I freely admit that my scripts are poorly-annotated, clunky, innefficient and just plain ugly. If nevertheless you are a brave soul and will dare to try to understand and re-use them, please feel free to contact me at raf.marcondes@gmail.com if you need help.

If you adapt ot re-use any of my scripts, please consider citing this repository or the PeerJ manuscript in any resulting publications.

Thanks for visiting this repository!
